Assumptions and references:

In TaxiClusters.java :

line 81 (in rangeQuery method): made the assumption that Q is not a neighbour of itself.

Lines 91-143: Algorthim used for the DBSCAN method in TaxiClusters.java is a reference to the psuedocode from the wiki article on DBSCAN algorithm.

Intstructions on how to run:

1. Set values for epsilon and minPts in main method in TaxiClusters.java (line 139). Default are minPts: 5, eps: 0.0001
2. Run the main method in TaxiClusters.java.
3. This will create a csv file called finalOutput.csv. This file displays the results that can then be compared to the prof's sample output 
in (Sample Output.csv). The attributes that are produced are for the cluster ID number, average longitudes and latitudes, and the number of points in each of the clusters
